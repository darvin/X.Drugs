🌍Find alternative brand names for any drug across the world with our GPT and vector database-powered application!💊


App helps users find alternative brand names for a particular drug when it is unavailable due to various reasons such as war, disaster or unavailability of the prescribed medication. The app can also help users find available humanitarian aids that have the same medication but under different brand names.

The application is powered by a combination of GPT and vector databases that are trained to recognize and match different brand names for the same medication. When a user inputs the name of a drug, the app searches its database for alternative brand names of the same medication and present a list of options to the user. The app can also provide information on the composition, dosage and side effects of each medication to help users make an informed choice.

To make the app more user-friendly, it can be designed with an intuitive user interface that allows users to easily search for alternative brand names of a particular drug. The app can also include a feature that allows users to save their search results for future reference.
